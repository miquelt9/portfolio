## Our project

[HackUPC](https://hackupc.com/) is the main yearly hackathon organized in my university. In 2023 was my first time attending on site.

Me, [AlexRG03](https://github.com/AlexRG03), [Martaw-code](https://github.com/Martaw-code) and [Koldp](https://github.com/Koldp/) took part at the competition. We were very indecisive in terms of which challenge to go for, but in the end we decided to work in the HP challenge, in which we had to build a prediction model to forecast the supply chain inventory units of HP.
Because we wanted to get even more work we were also thinking about how to solve other challenges and even coding a bot that battled in a survival game between all other hackers.

With almost no experience in forescast models we started reading, asking and trying things until our model had more and more issues, that night we used debugging powers (didn't sleep) in order to solve them and get something in the last minute. Unfortunately because we weren't on our best we didn't have time to create a nice looking platform to show our results as they could be display for HP, so we just showed them our numerical results...
