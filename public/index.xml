That&amp;rsquo;s why the task is to predict which will be the European contry that will have the highest surplus of green energy in the following hour. Knowing this information can be critical to make important decisions in order to reduce CO2 emissions. This challenge was the problem of a Nuwe competition.</description></item><item><title>Junction 2023</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/junction2023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/junction2023/</guid><description>Since I was in Finland for Erasmus, I decided it was a great opportunity to take part in a Hackathon there, and so I joined Junction 2023.
Our project Because creating habits is really important, Bernat, René and me, re-imagined Huawei Health app to make it attractive and satisfying for young people to do sports daily and weekly via a quests system with which everyone can compete as well as cooperate in order to get the most points across your friends and get better deals in Huawei products.</description></item><item><title>Otaniemi Tracker Bot</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/personal/otaniemi-tracker-bot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/personal/otaniemi-tracker-bot/</guid><description>The project On the fall semester of 2023-2024 I went abroad at Aalto University, as a Erasmus+ student I needed some place to stay during the period I was in Helsinki. However, even though me and a friend manage to get a nice apartment, we soon find out that most of the apartments rented there didn&amp;rsquo;t have any furtniture and people brought their own. Unfortunately as exchange students we couldn&amp;rsquo;t just rent a van a bring our bed, table and chair from the other side of Europe.</description></item><item><title>λ-Calculus Telegram Bot</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/college/lambdacalculustelegrambot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/college/lambdacalculustelegrambot/</guid><description>The statement The task was to build a lambda calculus interpreter. The interpreter also requiered to support the definition and use of macros. The interpreter had to run as a Telegram bot. It was needed that the bot could support sending the image of the tree interpratated, do ß-reductions and α-conversions.
The full statement can be found below or in the following site (in Catalan).
More than a complex project this just requiered spending time on making sure all the requierements were added after understanding how λ calculus works.</description></item><item><title>JBarcelona 2023</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/jobbarcelona2023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/jobbarcelona2023/</guid><description>The challenge This challenge was the problem of a Nuwe competition. The goal of the challenge was to build a classification model which had to predict which costumers decide to end their contracts with the company we get the data from, so the percentage of people who stop being clients decreses by analyzing the reasons.
The approach Since this was my first time building a model, I decided to start by looking at some guides and understand what had to exactly do the model.</description></item><item><title>HackUPC 2023</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hackupc2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hackupc2023/</guid><description>Our project HackUPC is the main yearly hackathon organized in my university. In 2023 was my first time attending on site.
Me, AlexRG03, Martaw-code and Koldp took part at the competition. We were very indecisive in terms of which challenge to go for, but in the end we decided to work in the HP challenge, in which we had to build a prediction model to forecast the supply chain inventory units of HP.</description></item><item><title>Falcon Explorer</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/college/falconexplorer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 06:00:14 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/college/falconexplorer/</guid><description>The statement The PROP college subject asked us to create an application to manage documents using Java. The app must allow the user to create, read, write, modify, delete, import and export files in various formats. One of the key features of the app is the queries to allow the user to find documents based on multiple arguments.
The full statement is in the document below (in Catalan).
Our approach Together with @AleexHrB, @LlucCC and @eZWALT, we made a case diagram to list all the features and functionalities our app had to have.</description></item><item><title>PDDL on Mars</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/college/planification/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/college/planification/</guid><description>The statement In 2075, the first colonizers of Mars have established a network of bases throughout the geography of the planet. Moving between these bases is done by rovers that can move supplies and specialized personnel.
We are in charge of planning the movements of the rovers from the base where they are parked, to pick up the supplies and personnel, to bring them in the requested place. We&amp;rsquo;ve been told that there are always more requests for supplies and personnel of those that can be used (life on Mars is very hard).</description></item><item><title>Knowledge Based Systems</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/college/knowledgebasedsystems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/college/knowledgebasedsystems/</guid><description>The statement In order to keep the older population in shape we had to build a program that recommends exercises and activities that are appropiate taking into account all factors of the individual and how may effect on the performance and goals.
I.e.: given certain information about a person, we had to output an exercise plan suitable for him/her.
The full statement is in the document below.

This was a problem set by Qualcomm for the FME Datathon 2022 which had the aim of minimizing the power loss across a chip.
Our approach Together with Paula, Ruth, Àlex and I, we decided to approach the problem by modelling it by considering a graph where the nodes are pins and the edges cables.</description></item><item><title>Local Search</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/college/localsearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/college/localsearch/</guid><description>The statement Given a set of power plants and clients, we had to optimize the profit. Power gets drained depending on the distance it needs to travel, clients don&amp;rsquo;t pay the same (not all of them are requiered to be served) and power plants costs depend on their size.
To solve the problem, we were asked to use Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing.
The full statement below (in Spanish).
Our solution Together with @JCasahuga and @XBLOYT, we used AIMA library and we determined the initial state, the operands as well as the heuristic function.</description></item><item><title>Google Hash Code 2022</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hashcode2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hashcode2022/</guid><description>Google Hash Code is a team programming competition that lasts about 4 hours, in which a solution to multiple inputs of a problem must be given, points are given depending on how good it is. Not happy enought with the result we got during our last attempt at this competition we decided to try again.
The problem In 2022 a list of contributors (with mastered skills) and a list of projects with different skill requirements were given.</description></item><item><title>Royal Hackaway v6</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/royalhackawayv6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/royalhackawayv6/</guid><description>Our project When @BernatBC, @alexland7219, @Loparc, and I discovered that a shark plushies were one of the prizes of an clearly underated challenge, we realized that the UK&amp;rsquo;s hackathons needed a way to optimally distribute the shark flushies across the country.
Therefore, we develop a simulator that allows them to place the distribution centers and hackathons (and link them), as well as how many plushie vans you want and its capacity, and it will find a optimal route at the same time it satisfies the demand.</description></item><item><title>HackUPC 2021</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hackupc2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hackupc2021/</guid><description>HackUPC is the main yearly hackathon organized in my university. In 2021 because of the pandemic we decided to take part from home.
Our project @BernatBC, @JCasahuga and I went to it as 1st year students, it was indeed our first hackathon. We were there for fun and learning new things. That year, the project didn&amp;rsquo;t have to had a theme (even though later we found people tend to do one of the partners challenges).</description></item><item><title>Google Hash Code 2021</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hashcode2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hashcode2021/</guid><description>Google Hash Code is a team programming competition that lasts about 4 hours, in which a solution to multiple inputs of a problem must be given, points are given depending on how good it is.
The problem In 2021 a city road network was given and planned paths for all cars in it, we had to optimize the schedule of traffic lights to minimize the total amount of time spent and help as many cars as possible reach their destination.</description></item><item><title>Resultados de Búsqueda</title><link>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/search/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Jun 2010 08:06:25 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miquelt.me/portfolio/search/</guid><description>Este archivo existe únicamente para responder a la URL /search con la plantilla de diseño search relacionada.
