Since I was in Finland for Erasmus, I decided it was a great opportunity to take part in a Hackathon there, and so I joined [Junction 2023](https://www.junction2023.com/).

## Our project
Because creating habits is really important, Bernat, Ren√© and me, re-imagined Huawei Health app to make it attractive and satisfying for young people to do sports daily and weekly via a quests system with which everyone can compete as well as cooperate in order to get the most points across your friends and get better deals in Huawei products.
