The app must allow the user to create, read, write, modify, delete, import and export files in various formats. One of the key features of the app is the queries to allow the user to find documents based on multiple arguments.
The full statement is in the document below (in Catalan).
Our approach Together with @AleexHrB, @LlucCC and @eZWALT, we made a case diagram to list all the features and functionalities our app had to have.</description></item><item><title>Local Search</title><link>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/college/localsearch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/college/localsearch/</guid><description>The statement Given a set of power plants and clients, we had to optimize the profit. Power gets drained depending on the distance it needs to travel, clients don&amp;rsquo;t pay the same (not all of them are requiered to be served) and power plants costs depend on their size.
To solve the problem, we were asked to use Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing.
The full statement below (in Spanish).
Our solution Together with @JCasahuga and @XBLOYT, we used AIMA library and we determined the initial state, the operands as well as the heuristic function.</description></item></channel></rss>
