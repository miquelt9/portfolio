### Portfolio
This ```main``` branch is just for the README file, the code that I edit is on the ```source```, then a Github Action is triggered and the website is build in ```gh-pages```branch.
The portfolio [website](https://miquelt9.github.io/portfolio/) complements the main [website](https://miquelt9.github.io) by showing more projects.
