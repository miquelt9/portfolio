[Google Hash Code](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode) is a team programming competition that lasts about 4 hours, in which a solution to multiple inputs of a problem must be given, points are given depending on how good it is. Not happy enought with the result we got during our last attempt at this competition we decided to try again.

## The problem
In 2022 a list of contributors (with mastered skills) and a list of projects with different skill requirements were given. Contributors could improve their skills by completing projects and can mentor each other to work is roles in which they couldn't succeed on their own. The task was to assign the contributors to project roles that fit them and maximize the score for completed projects.

The full problem statement is below:

## Our submission
Together with [@BernatBC](https://github.com/BernatBC), [@alexland7219](https://github.com/alexland7219) and I (as last year). Our first approach was to fill the first project available with the lowest skilled contributors. As soon a project has finalized, the contributors are assigned to the first project available that they can fit in. After solving a few bugs, we decided to generate our submission files. Little did we know that they were taking forever. With our knowledge no better ideas came to our mind that could be implemented in the time we had left, therefore we wished the best before submitting the files in the last minute. Luckily, even though the files were partial, the score was still computed. We ended with partial submissions (therefore partial score), but was good enough.

With our partial submission we obtained 1,477,643 points positioning ourselves in 3259 out of 10201, a little better than in 2021.

Unfortunately we later knew that 2022 was the last Google Hash Code contest, and no more would be taking place.
