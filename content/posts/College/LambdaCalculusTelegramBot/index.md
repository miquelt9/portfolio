## The statement
The task was to build a lambda calculus interpreter. The interpreter also requiered to support the definition and use of macros. The interpreter had to run as a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) bot. It was needed that the bot could support sending the image of the tree interpratated, do ß-reductions and α-conversions.

The full statement can be found below or in the following [site](https://gebakx.github.io/lp-achurch-23/) (in Catalan).

More than a complex project this just requiered spending time on making sure all the requierements were added after understanding how λ calculus works. I also decided to add some more features such as multiple languages and toogle some of the features.
