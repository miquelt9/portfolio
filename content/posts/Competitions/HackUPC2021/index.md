[HackUPC](https://hackupc.com/) is the main yearly hackathon organized in my university. In 2021 because of the pandemic we decided to take part from home.

## Our project
[@BernatBC](https://github.com/BernatBC), [@JCasahuga](https://github.com/JCasahuga) and I went to it as 1st year students, it was indeed our first hackathon. We were there for fun and learning new things. That year, the project didn't have to had a theme (even though later we found people tend to do one of the partners challenges). Without much knowledge we ended up creating a 2D game using Unity, given that two of us already had little experience and it was a great time learn how to develop further.

More information about the project can be found in [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/spaceshooter-5hi4of). Below you can try our game.
