      <description>Our project When @BernatBC, @alexland7219, @Loparc, and I discovered that a shark plushies were one of the prizes of an clearly underated challenge, we realized that the UK&amp;rsquo;s hackathons needed a way to optimally distribute the shark flushies across the country.
Therefore, we develop a simulator that allows them to place the distribution centers and hackathons (and link them), as well as how many plushie vans you want and its capacity, and it will find a optimal route at the same time it satisfies the demand.</description>

      <description>HackUPC is the main yearly hackathon organized in my university. In 2021 because of the pandemic we decided to take part from home.
Our project @BernatBC, @JCasahuga and I went to it as 1st year students, it was indeed our first hackathon. We were there for fun and learning new things. That year, the project didn&amp;rsquo;t have to had a theme (even though later we found people tend to do one of the partners challenges).</description>
