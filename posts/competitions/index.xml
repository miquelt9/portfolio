That&amp;rsquo;s why the task is to predict which will be the European contry that will have the highest surplus of green energy in the following hour. Knowing this information can be critical to make important decisions in order to reduce CO2 emissions. This challenge was the problem of a Nuwe competition.</description></item><item><title>Junction 2023</title><link>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/junction2023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/junction2023/</guid><description>Since I was in Finland for Erasmus, I decided it was a great opportunity to take part in a Hackathon there, and so I joined Junction 2023.
Our project Because creating habits is really important, Bernat, René and me, re-imagined Huawei Health app to make it attractive and satisfying for young people to do sports daily and weekly via a quests system with which everyone can compete as well as cooperate in order to get the most points across your friends and get better deals in Huawei products.</description></item><item><title>JBarcelona 2023</title><link>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/jobbarcelona2023/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/jobbarcelona2023/</guid><description>The challenge This challenge was the problem of a Nuwe competition. The goal of the challenge was to build a classification model which had to predict which costumers decide to end their contracts with the company we get the data from, so the percentage of people who stop being clients decreses by analyzing the reasons.
The approach Since this was my first time building a model, I decided to start by looking at some guides and understand what had to exactly do the model.</description></item><item><title>HackUPC 2023</title><link>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hackupc2023/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2023 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hackupc2023/</guid><description>Our project HackUPC is the main yearly hackathon organized in my university. In 2023 was my first time attending on site.
Me, AlexRG03, Martaw-code and Koldp took part at the competition. We were very indecisive in terms of which challenge to go for, but in the end we decided to work in the HP challenge, in which we had to build a prediction model to forecast the supply chain inventory units of HP.</description></item><item><title>Chips-Chips</title><link>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/funcions-numerables/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/funcions-numerables/</guid><description>The challenge The goal of this challenge was to minimize the average length of chains that connected pins in a chip, while also trying to minimize the standard deviation of the lengths of the different chains. This was a problem set by Qualcomm for the FME Datathon 2022 which had the aim of minimizing the power loss across a chip.
Our approach Together with Paula, Ruth, Àlex and I, we decided to approach the problem by modelling it by considering a graph where the nodes are pins and the edges cables.</description></item><item><title>Google Hash Code 2022</title><link>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hashcode2022/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hashcode2022/</guid><description>Google Hash Code is a team programming competition that lasts about 4 hours, in which a solution to multiple inputs of a problem must be given, points are given depending on how good it is. Not happy enought with the result we got during our last attempt at this competition we decided to try again.
The problem In 2022 a list of contributors (with mastered skills) and a list of projects with different skill requirements were given.</description></item><item><title>Royal Hackaway v6</title><link>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/royalhackawayv6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/royalhackawayv6/</guid><description>Our project When @BernatBC, @alexland7219, @Loparc, and I discovered that a shark plushies were one of the prizes of an clearly underated challenge, we realized that the UK&amp;rsquo;s hackathons needed a way to optimally distribute the shark flushies across the country.
Therefore, we develop a simulator that allows them to place the distribution centers and hackathons (and link them), as well as how many plushie vans you want and its capacity, and it will find a optimal route at the same time it satisfies the demand.</description></item><item><title>HackUPC 2021</title><link>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hackupc2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 May 2021 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hackupc2021/</guid><description>HackUPC is the main yearly hackathon organized in my university. In 2021 because of the pandemic we decided to take part from home.
Our project @BernatBC, @JCasahuga and I went to it as 1st year students, it was indeed our first hackathon. We were there for fun and learning new things. That year, the project didn&amp;rsquo;t have to had a theme (even though later we found people tend to do one of the partners challenges).</description></item><item><title>Google Hash Code 2021</title><link>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hashcode2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 06:00:23 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://miqueltv.me/portfolio/posts/competitions/hashcode2021/</guid><description>Google Hash Code is a team programming competition that lasts about 4 hours, in which a solution to multiple inputs of a problem must be given, points are given depending on how good it is.
The problem In 2021 a city road network was given and planned paths for all cars in it, we had to optimize the schedule of traffic lights to minimize the total amount of time spent and help as many cars as possible reach their destination.</description></item></channel></rss>
